(h) Dynamical structure factor calculation powder averaged S(Q,E)
(i) Dynamics structure factor calculation single crystal, Neutron/X-ray weighted S(Q,E)
(j) Powder averaged atomic resolved Quasi-elastic-neutron spectra 
(k) Spectral energy density functional calculation
(l) Acoustic phonon dispersion in liquid/amorphous/crystallinematerials
(m) Atomic-Pair resolved diffuse scattering, Neutron and X-ray weighted 
(n) Atomic probbaility density function calculation 
(o) Free energy land-scape as a function of r with respect to initial site
(p) Bond-angle distribution
