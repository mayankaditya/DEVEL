Molecular Dynamics Post-Processing Suits To simulate Neutron & X-ray Scattering Experiments and Calculations of transport properties (The current version processes the LAMMPS, VASP, DL-POLY, and GPUMD trajectories).
This is a postprocessing tool with the following features:

(a) Mean squared displacement
(b) Phonon Density of States 
(c) Neutron Weighted phonon density of states
(d) Pair-distribution function
(e) X-ray and neutron-weighted pair distribution function
(f) Anisotropic displacement pattern
(g) Van-Hove correlation function
(h) Dynamical structure factor calculation powder averaged S(Q, E)
(i) Dynamics structure factor calculation single crystal, Neutron/X-ray weighted S(Q, E)
(j) Powder averaged atomic resolved Quasi-elastic-neutron spectra 
(k) Spectral energy density functional calculation
(l) Acoustic phonon dispersion in liquid/amorphous/crystalline materials
(m) Atomic-Pair resolved diffuse scattering, Neutron and X-ray weighted 
(n) Atomic probability density function calculation 
(o) Free energy landscape as a function of r with respect to the initial site
(p) Bond-angle distribution
(q) Polyhedral bond angle time dependence with respect to the unique axis
(r) Diffraction pattern
(s) Neutron/X-ray weighted diffraction pattern
(t) Velocity Auto-correlation function
(u) Diffusion Coefficient (from VACF and MSD)
